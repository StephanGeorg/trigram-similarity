# trigram-similarity [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/trigram-similarity.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/trigram-similarity)

The trigram-similarity module provides functions and operators for determining the similarity of alphanumeric text based on trigram matching.
This is the JavaScript implementation of Postgres [pg_trgm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/pgtrgm.html) and returns a number that indicates how 
similar the two arguments are. 

The range of the result is **zero** (indicating that the two strings are completely dissimilar) to **one** (indicating 
that the two strings are identical).
